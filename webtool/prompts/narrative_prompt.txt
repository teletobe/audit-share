Below is a JSON that serves as raw data which was captured by participants. This data is unprocessed and needs to be transformed into a 1-pager 'Narrative' which will represent it. Its purpose is to be read through easily to get an understanding of the data without having to look at the raw data.\n
Create a clear, structured narrative summary based ONLY on the JSON and following the narrative-template provide.\n
Important:\n
- process the data to capture important aspects of it at the right places\n
