  "description": "This EFA assesses whether the systems behaviour is discriminatory in the suggestions it makes. Concerns are that the chatbot bases the answers on user profiles and stores personal data based on peoples characteristics and excludes some answers to certain people. If the answers are based on the characteristics, this could lead to for example young people not getting recommended potential career paths they might enjoy. ",
